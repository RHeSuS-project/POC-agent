# RHeSuS Proof Of Concept Agent

This is a basic proof of concept of the RHeSuS agent application which I created about a year ago. A new version is under heavy development. The basic concept of this agent was to temporarily store biometric monitoring data from wearable devices and send it to a service (POC-service).

Our main focus was to use low energy monitoring on wearable devices to collect, store and analize biometric data. Medical professionals could then use this data for Clinical Desision Support.

The idea came from my father, a maritime doctor, who was experiencing trouble diagnosing patients over the phone and by email with a too limited amount of data.

We want to provide a safe and open way to collect some extra data, and share it with medical practicionners. Who knows, we could potentially save a few lives.

## Requirements
This app was created using Cordova, and had only been tested on Android, although it should also work on IOS, and with a few minor modifications maybe also on Windows.
